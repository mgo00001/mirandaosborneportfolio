    <p class="grid_22 prefix_1 suffix_1 alpha omega">Access+Ability is an exhibition from the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum that was on display in Winter of 2018. The theme and main focus of this exhibition was the cretion and innovation of accessibility-centered technology. Artifacts would range from "tattoo" prosthetic legs, to a pill bottle that lights up each time you need to take medicine. As someone with sensory issues, this exhbition spoke to me, so when approaching the task of turning it into a catalogue package, I really wanted to do it justice with a sense of appreciation and sincereity.</p>

<div class="grid_24 section1 alpha omega">
    <img class="grid_10 prefix_1 suffix_2 alpha omega" src="images/miniposter1.jpg" alt="A mini poster showing different tatoo prosthetic legs that says: Taking tattoo to another level.">
    <img id="miniposter2" class="grid_10 suffix_1 alpha omega" src="images/miniposter2.jpg" alt="A mini poster showing a racing wheelchair that says: Race your own way.">
   <p class="grid_22 prefix_1 suffix_1 alpha omega">To further establish a connection between the exhibition itself and the catalogue, incorporating accessibility into the catalogue itself through various design choices was essential. Examples of these design choices include high contrast in color and using type that is ADA compliant. The title type is actually the same type used for subtitles on television in the UK!</p>

   <p class="grid_22 prefix_1 suffix_1 alpha omega">Finally, a few mini-posters that would be included with the catalogue if purchased were designed. These posters emmulate the celebretory essense of the exhibit itself and bring awareness to accessibility issues. Artifacts from the exhibit are used as a focus point to shine a light on specific areas of the exhibit like objects based on physical or sensory limitations.</p>
