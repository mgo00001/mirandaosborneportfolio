    <p class="grid_22 prefix_1 suffix_1 alpha omega">As a lifelong native to a community near the small city of Welch, West Virginia I am no stranger to the issues present and the lack of tourism in the area. Once a booming city during the peak of coal production during the 1950s, Welch is a historical city located in McDowell County, WV. Known for coal production, hospitality, and humbleness, this city has a special place in the hearts of locals that this project aimed to express through graphic design conventions!</p>

    <img class="grid_20 prefix_2 suffix_2 alpha omega" src="images/welchvideo2.png" alt="Screenshot from the video which shows a car approaching the local Sterling Drive-In Restaurant.">

    <p class="grid_22 prefix_1 suffix_1 alpha omega">Through research on the history of Welch, its most popular attractions, and best potential qualities, a welcoming video that introduces the viewer to the town and all it has to offer was conceptualized. This project served as a means to greatly hone in on  skills of creating original assests for projects, as well as storyboarding and video editing.</p>
